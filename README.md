Hello my name is Norbert,<br />

I am an IT Quality Assurance specialist with just under three years of experience in testing both games and applications. Throughout my career, I have developed a deep understanding of what it takes to deliver high-quality software products that meet and exceed user expectations.

My work involves meticulously testing software applications and games to ensure that they are free from defects and perform as expected. I take pride in creating test cases, executing tests, and identifying and reporting defects in a timely manner. I am highly skilled in using various testing tools and techniques to ensure that the software products are fully functional and user-friendly.

What sets me apart is my strong familiarity with coding. I have a deep understanding of programming languages and am able to identify issues and pinpoint their root cause. This makes it easier to work with developers to fix any issues that arise during the testing process.

In summary, I'm looking for the next step to develop my skills and work on building great products that meet and exceed customer expectations, and deliver them in close collaboration with the team and help applications and games reach new heights..<br />
